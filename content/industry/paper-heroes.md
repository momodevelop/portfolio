[Paper Heroes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udream.PaperHeroes) is a Android game written with Unity by UDream Entertainment. It is a lightweight, casual and idle strategy game, where you form your team of paper-styled pirates and battle against other crews
                
The game is currently avaliable globally on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udream.PaperHeroes).

In this project, I worked as a backend engineer. My responsibilities include the backend architecture of the game, which includes server-side gameplay code, build/deployment pipeline, structuring databases and determining the data pipeline for business analytics.

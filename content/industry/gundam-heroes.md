[Gundam Heroes](https://www.gematsu.com/2018/01/gundam-heroes-announced-pc-browser) is a PC browser game published by Bandai Namco. It is a real time strategy game  where players will command a team of heroes from the Gundam series to battle against other enemy teams.
                    
The game was only avaliable in Japan and is currently not in service. 

I was part of the team based in Koei Tecmo outsourced to implement a part of the game. Our responsibilities include implementing features outside of the main game such as matchmaking lobbies, guild systems and player information windows.

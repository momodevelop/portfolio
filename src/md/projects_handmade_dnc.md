In the spirit of Handmade, this project is my attempt to write a game and a game engine with as few libraries as possible. Libraries will only be used after thorough evaluation (e.g. cmaths is useful because it deals with intrinsics) but otherwise, everything else will be written from scratch.

The target game will be similar to the **Dots and Circles** student game I made with another friend. It will run on Windows although I hope to run it on Linux and even Raspberry Pi if possible.

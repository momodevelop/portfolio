		<h1 id="hey-im-gerald">Hey, I&rsquo;m Gerald!</h1>
<p>This is my home page! I am a software engineer with a passion for teaching. My specialization is in games development, but I love to learn about technology from other fields as well!</p>
<h1 id="im-a-programmer">I&rsquo;m a programmer</h1>
<p>I have been programming for 13 years. I have spent a total of around 6 professional years in the game industry. 5 of them were spent in Koei Tecmo Singapore and 1 was in Udream Entertainment.</p>
<p>My portfolio in the industry includes console, web and mobile titles. I have experience in both development and operational cycles of a title, and have lead teams in those environments.</p>
<p>I enjoy working on most software engineering aspects of a project. I have developed content for frontend, planned/setup the infrastructure for backend, and came up with build systems and tools for the various projects I&rsquo;m involved in.</p>
<h1 id="im-a-lecturer">I&rsquo;m a lecturer</h1>
<p>I teach at a tertiary level. I have spent 2 years as a lecturer at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore.</p>
<p>The topics I teach were mostly related to my experience in the industry, which revolves around games development, software engineering and programming.</p>
